# TrainScheduler

07 Firebase Homework. A Train Schedule

## Usage

This page incorporates a firebase database to allow users to enter in a train along with it's time, Destination, and frequency of running.

The javascript interacts with the database and the JS library moment.js. it calculates the next train departure both in real time and in minutes away.

The page display is visually coded to realy more inforamtion to the viewer. Trains that are next arriving within ten minutes will be highlighted in red. Trains arriving in less than 30 minutes are higlighted in yellow, and trains that do not arrive again until tomorrow are faded.

## Further

I have added a live clock, but was unable to do much in terms of sorting the table as I had hoped. I may come back to it, but all my thoughts are on Project 1 and Im ready to dive in deep with it.
